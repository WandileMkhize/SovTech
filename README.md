This is the Link to my site - https://sovtech-xi.vercel.app/

I bootstrapped it through installing VS code, downloading React.js framework
I created my index.jss page within my files, enabling it to run only as a static single page with no dependencies
Downloaded JQuery within VS
I Load Bootstrap JavaScript
Added a Navigation Bar
I then included Custom CSS code on a different page to manage structure and appearance of my web page
I added content and wrote it to keep it simple
I uploaded it on my GIT account
Then used vercel to integrate my git with vercel to upload it online

NB: this was my first time using these technologies
